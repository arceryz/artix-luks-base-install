# artix-luks-base-install

A fully self-contained Artix Linux base installation script that installs the
base system with an encrypted disk on /root /home and /swap using cryptsetup.
The script is fully automated with no interaction from start to finish.
Parameters are given as command line arguments.

The installer is only configured to work with EFI systems and installs the runit
init system by default. By default it allocates 12G for /swap, 50G for /root and
everything else for /home. This should be sufficient for most configurations.

Features:
- EFI only.
- Encrypted /root /home and /swap using LVM on LUKS encryption technique.
- Runit init system (replaces systemd).
- Configures defaults for locale, sudoers and networking.
- Small and well documented script, no bloat.
